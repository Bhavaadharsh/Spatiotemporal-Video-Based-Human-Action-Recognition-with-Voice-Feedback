# Spatiotemporal-Video-Based-Human-Action-Recognition-with-Voice-Feedback
The primary objective of this project is to develop a Human Action Recognition (HAR) system that assists visually impaired individuals by providing real-time feedback about human actions around them.
Specific Objectives:
  Detect and classify 15 common human actions (e.g., running, sleeping, cycling, listening to music).
  Leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for accurate and efficient action recognition.
  Provide auditory or haptic feedback to the user in real-time.
  Design a system optimized for real-world use in varied environments
